# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

## Description

Tasks on .

What I learned from the tasks:

* What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
* What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
* What are the differences between static and shared libraries
* Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig

---

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim and emacs.
* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS using using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
* Code checked with betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life](./libdynamic.so)
* Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so


### [1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future](./1-create_dynamic_lib.sh)
* Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

### [1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future](./1-create_dynamic_lib.sh)
* Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

### [2. Let's call C functions from Python](./100-operations.so)
* Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. See example for more detail.

### [3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!](./101-make_me_win.sh)
* I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
	- Our mole got us a copy of the program, you can download it [here](./https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x18.c).
	- ou canâ€™t modify the program gm itself as Master Sysadmin Sylvain (MSS) always checks its MD5 before running it
	- The system is an Linux Ubuntu 20.04
	- The server has internet access
	- Our mole will be only able to run two commands from a shell script, without being detected by MSS
	- Your shell script should be maximum 3 lines long. You are not allowed to use ;, &&, ||, |, ` (it would be detected by MSS), and have a maximum of two commands
	- Our mole has only the authorization to upload one file on the server. It will be your shell script
	- Our mole will run your shell script this way: mss@gm_server$ . ./101-make_me_win.sh
	- Our mole will run your shell script from the same directory containing the program gm, exactly 98 seconds before MSS runs gm with my numbers: ./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9
	- MSS will use the same terminal and session than our mole
	- Before running the gm program, MSS always check the content of the directory
	- MSS always exit after running the program gm
